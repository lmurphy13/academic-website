					Friday October 15, 2021: Continued work on <code>Arm/Codegen.java</code>. Had some realizations about the ARM architecture vs. MIPS, so I needed to refactor a bit of the code. Some legacy things like <code>Frame.					ZERO</code> were retained in order to make code emission easier. In the <code>Arm</code> package, <code>Frame.ZERO</code> has been itialized as <code>#0</code>, since MIPS uses a zero register to hold the same value. The easiest solution, to me, was to just set that "register" to the immediate zero value.

					Wednesday October 13, 2021: Had weekly meeting with Dr. Brylow. Had a good discussion and several questions answered. Contacted Alex G. to get a copy of the Research Xinu source.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Code Progress:</strong>
					<br>
					Finished initial modifications of <code>Arm/ArmFrame.java, Arm/InReg.java, Arm/InFrame.java</code>. Started working on <code>Arm/Codegen.java</code>. Worked on converting store convention from Mips to Arm.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Writing Progress:</strong>
					<br>
					More messing around with formatting. Got the go-ahead from Dr. Brylow to start writing some sections. Will start on Background chapter this week. 
					It is still unclear what the overall goal is of the thesis, but that's okay for now.

					Saturday October 9, 2021: Bookmarked important sections of <i>Dragon Book</i> Chapter 8 and Appel Chapter 8. Started considering how to create Arm Basic Blocks. Wrote a cheatsheet on Arm 32 bit registers. 
				</p>

				<p>
					Friday October 8, 2021: Read the first half of <i>Dragon Book</i> Chapter 8. Looked more at existing compiler codebase. Began thinking about thesis chapters.

					Thursday October 7, 2021: Dr. Brylow gave me access to the ConcurrentMiniJava compiler GitHub repository. I have forked that repository into my own GitHub account. After doing so, I cloned the repo to my Morbius
					home directory. I began laying out the <code>Arm</code> package. I have also written a bash script to build the compiler for me. I will need to brush up on my ARM assembly.

					<strong>TODO: </strong>Ask Dr. Brylow for the latest stable version of multicore Embedded Xinu.

					Wednesday September 29, 2021: Met with Dr. Brylow to go over expectations and to discuss a topic.
					A topic was selected: work on porting the MiniJava compiler to ARM and bring in cryptography and concurrency libraries.
