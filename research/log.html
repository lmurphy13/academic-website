					Thursday October 7, 2021: Dr. Brylow gave me access to the ConcurrentMiniJava compiler GitHub repository. I have forked that repository into my own GitHub account. After doing so, I cloned the repo to my Morbius
					home directory. I began laying out the <code>Arm</code> package. I have also written a bash script to build the compiler for me. I will need to brush up on my ARM assembly.
